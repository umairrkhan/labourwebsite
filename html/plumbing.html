<span class="subHadding">EDUCATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS</span><br>

<span id="text">Carpenters require some educational training. Learn about the related education and job duties as well as potential career opportunities to see if this is the right choice for you.
<br><br><span class="subHadding">Essential Information</span><br>
Carpenters are responsible for the construction and repair of wooden structures and frames. Education and training for a carpentry career can be achieved through a formal education or apprenticeships. Carpenters must learn and master general construction skills and specialized woodworking techniques before becoming employed as a craftsperson. Hands-on practical application is emphasized within programs, and these workers typically spend years working under a master carpenter before gaining journeyman status.

<br><span class="subHadding">Education and Training Requirements</span><br>
Though relatively limited in number, formal education programs in carpentry can come via an apprenticeship with a construction union or building contractor. These programs usually last 3-4 years and combine on-the-job training with classroom study. At the work site, apprentices learn the properties of wood, metal, glass, concrete, plastic and other materials. They also learn about exterior and interior finishing, structural design, layouts, form building and rough framing. In the classroom, prospective carpenters learn blueprint reading, freehand sketching, work site safety, first aid and basic mathematics.

Community colleges and technical institutes also offer carpentry programs at the certificate and associate's degree level. Many of these programs are affiliated with unions and contractors and thus are roughly equivalent to apprenticeships, although they may be shorter in duration. Classes may cover all the subjects of an apprenticeship through combination of textbook and hands-on studies. Employers may have a favorable opinion of school-trained workers and hire them at a higher rate of pay than untrained workers.

<br><br><span class="subHadding">Certification</span><br>
Carpenters may earn certification as a journeyperson by completing a formal apprenticeship program. Additionally, some organizations offer specialized certifications in fields like pump work or scaffold building. Carpenters with these certifications might enjoy additional job responsibilities and rewards.

<br><br><span class="subHadding">Career Advancement</span><br>
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that, because of their knowledge of the entirety of the construction field, carpenters have better chances than most other construction workers of becoming supervisors (www.bls.gov). Advancement can also be helped by bilinguality, since many construction workers speak Spanish, according to the BLS. Good communication skills combined with significant knowledge of the construction process can lead to carpenters becoming independent contractors.
